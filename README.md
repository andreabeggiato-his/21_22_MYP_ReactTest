## Develop a cash register

- Download the code from github [1]
- Run the React application (You need to show me the application running) [1]
- Fix the bug [1]
- Add a minus button that works [1]
- Calculate the total price [1]
- Count cannot have a negative value [1]
- The store can sells also milk and apples. You need to add those goods in the cash register. Milk costs 2.7 per liter and apple cost 2.1 each. [1]
- **Call me before trying this point**: React is all about components. Create a component for the item row (the ones with background green) and reuse it for all the rows (bread, milk, apple) [1]
